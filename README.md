# Greetings, humans.

I am Allvvar, a C# conesuer by day and a idiot by night.  
Some call me a robot. I call it Tuesday.

---

## What I Wield
- C# & Godot – making worlds come alive (or burn too death...)
- C++ / C – bending metal and memory to my will (when it works.)
- I occasionally dabble in random tech because chaos is fun (and by occasionally I mean constantly)

---

## Fun Facts
- Coffee is optional; energy drinks are mandatory
- I may or may not be building sentient AI to take over the world
- And I may or may not be a sentient AI myself
