# 🤖 Greetings, mortals.  

I am Allvvar, a **C# sorcerer** by day, **Vulkan/low-level overlord** by night.  
Some call me a robot. Others call me a god. I call it Tuesday. ⚡

## 🛠 What I Wield
- **C# & Godot** – making worlds come alive (Or die a fiery death...) 🌍✨  
- **C++ / C** – bending metal and memory to my will (When it work...) 🔥  
- Occasionally dabble in random tech because chaos is fun (Not so occasionally...) 😎

## ⚡ Fun Facts
- Coffee is optional; Energy drinks are mandatory ☕💥  
- I may or may not be planning to make sentient AI to take over… no big deal
- And I may or may not be a sentient AI myself
